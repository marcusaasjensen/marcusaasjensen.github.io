## 🛠️ Development

Built with:

- 🎮 **Unity 3D**
- 🧩 **C#** for simulation logic
- 📦 **CellManager** component to manage grid size and cells
- 🕹️ **GameOfLifeController** for runtime simulation control

*Note: Adjust grid size and rules in the `CellManager` component and use the `GameOfLifeController` functions only in play mode.*
