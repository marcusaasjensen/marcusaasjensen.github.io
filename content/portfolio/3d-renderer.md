✨ **3D Renderer** is a CPU-based 3D renderer written in C++20, supporting simple primitive shapes and built entirely from scratch. It offers both perspective and orthographic projections and supports simple `.obj` imports.

---

## 🛠️ Features
- 🧱 **Primitive Shapes**: Render basic shapes like cubes, spheres, and pyramids.
- 🖼️ **.obj Import**: Load and render simple `.obj` files.
- 🔄 **Projection Modes**: Switch between perspective and orthographic projections.
- 🖥️ **CPU-Based**: Built entirely from scratch without relying on external graphics libraries.
