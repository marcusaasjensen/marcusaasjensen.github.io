**Uncanny** is a fast-paced action rhythm game where you must dodge and dash through uncanny boss attacks. Drawing inspiration from *Just Shapes & Beats* and *Cuphead*, it offers a unique blend of rhythm-based gameplay and bullet hell mechanics.

Developed in just one week for a game jam, the game features two main levels, each culminating in a special boss fight. With original music, animation, and art, *Uncanny* is a passion project that showcases the developer's dedication to creating engaging and atmospheric experiences.
