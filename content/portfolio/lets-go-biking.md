üö¥ **Let's Go Biking** is a school project designed to provide a convenient itinerary for cyclists traveling between two addresses using the JCDecaux bike service. The application functions as a self-hosted SOAP server on the server side, accompanied by a robust Java-based heavy client. Utilizing WCF servers, the app communicates through REST APIs and a routing service with proxy and cache, connecting seamlessly with providers like JCDecaux and OpenRouteService.
