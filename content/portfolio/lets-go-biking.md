🚴 **Let's Go Biking** is a school project designed to provide a convenient itinerary for cyclists traveling between two addresses using the JCDecaux bike service. The application functions as a self-hosted SOAP server on the server side, accompanied by a robust Java-based heavy client. Utilizing WCF servers, the app communicates through REST APIs and a routing service with proxy and cache, connecting seamlessly with providers like JCDecaux and OpenRouteService.

## 🔧 Setup

Open git bash and clone the project folder.
```git
git clone https://github.com/marcusaasjensen/lets-go-biking.git
```
Open the cloned project folder *lets-go-biking*.

Setup your API keys in a .env file inside the Server folder.

Replace the fields by your API keys for each services and according to the following *.env.template* file.
```dotenv
OPEN_ROUTE_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_api_key
JCDECAUX_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

{% admonition(type="tip", title="Tip") %}
You can create accounts on both services to get your API keys.
- JCDecaux API key: https://developer.jcdecaux.com/
- Open Route Service Api key: https://openrouteservice.org/
{% end %}

Open the *Server/LetsGoBiking.sln* project file with Visual Studio.

Right click on Solution and select *"Build Solution"* and wait until successful build.

{% admonition(type="warning", title="Warning") %}
Make sure to use the **Java Version 11** to run the client side afterwards.
Also check if you have **maven** installed.
{% end %}

### Launch the app simply 🖱️
Click on the *LetsGoBiking.bat* file.

### Launch the app manually ⚙️

First, run both the Routing and the ProxyCache servers inside the associated folders:
- *Server/ProxyCacheServer/bin/Release/ProxycacheServer.exe*
- *Server/RoutingServer/bin/Release/RoutingServer.exe*

Secondly, open the command prompt in the Client folder and run in order:

```mvn
mvn clean install
mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.soc.testwsclient.Main"
```

*Or (using IntelliJ)*

Open the Client project inside IntelliJ idea, and run in the local terminal: 

```mvn
mvn clean install
```

Finally, compile and run the main class.
