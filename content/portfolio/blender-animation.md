## 🌌 Concept

**Marionette** began as a character I sketched two years before and slowly evolved into a nine-second 3D short.  
The puppet lives in contradiction with **its chains both restraining and sustaining it** which reflects the way our insecurities can trap us while also defining who we are.
Its awkward, eerie movements become a quiet metaphor for learning to live with the strings we cannot fully cut.

## 🎶 Original Music

To give the animation its bittersweet atmosphere, I composed an **original theme in FL Studio** specifically for the marionette.  
The music mirrors the fragile tension of the character and its quiet innocence, amplifying the emotional contrast between restraint and freedom.

## 🎨 Creation Process

This was my **first fully-modeled and animated 3D character**, made entirely in **Blender**:
- Custom rigging with **constraints** for precise control  
- **Chain physics (baked)** to bring the strings to life
- **Lattice modifier** for subtle hair motion  
- **Original music** to reinforce the mood  

What started as a simple experiment in 3D became a personal artistic journey combining drawing, modeling, and animation into a single expressive piece.

## ✏️ From Drawing to Model

The marionette’s design originated from a hand-drawn concept, reimagined in 3D while keeping the fragile, almost magical aesthetic of the original illustration.

## 🙏 Reflection

Learning Blender after years of 2D animation in Unity opened new creative doors.  
This project taught me to translate a still drawing into a living character and gave me a first taste of storytelling in three dimensions.
