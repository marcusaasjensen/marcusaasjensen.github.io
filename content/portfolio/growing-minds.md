## üå± Project Overview
This project was carried out as a **group project of 3 students** in the context of **research on serious games and the digitalization of educational tools**.  
The objective was to bring an existing **board game about biodiversity** into a **digital format** using Unity, while preserving its **collaborative** and **educational** nature.

The **original board game "Growing Minds"** was created by **Saumya Grover** and **Nimet H√ºma Sabirli**. After being tested in schools worldwide, the authors sought to explore digitalization as a way to broaden its reach and integrate it into modern learning environments.  

Our challenge was to ensure that the **playful, outdoor, and collaborative benefits** of the original were preserved in the digital version.

The project was conducted under the supervision and guidance of:  
- [Hui-Yin Wu](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Hui-Yin.Wu/) (Professor, Inria)  
- [Pauline Devictor](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/pauline-devictor-92a02b233) (Research & Project Supervisor)  

{% admonition(type="warning", title="Note") %}
This project is not available for public use. It is presented here as part of my portfolio to highlight my role in **managing the entire Unity project** and its technical implementation.

## üéÆ The Game
The digital version reimagines the board game with mechanics adapted to **mobile platforms (Android & iOS)**:
- Players begin with an **initial tile** and connect additional tiles to build an **ecosystem**.  
- Tiles represent **animals, plants, or natural elements**.  
- Connecting tiles reveals **rules** that grant points.  
  - Example: Connecting a **Bee** tile with a **Honey** tile unlocks the rule: *‚Äúthe bee makes honey‚Äù*.  
- Even when no explicit rule exists, connecting tiles with thematic links (e.g., animals or plants) still grants points.  
- Teachers can also **define custom rules**, making the experience flexible for classroom use.  

The project successfully translated the **serious game** into a **digital environment**, offering children an **interactive, collaborative, and educational experience**.

## üë©‚Äçüíª My Role
I was responsible for **managing the entire Unity project**:
- Building the game structure and ecosystem-connection mechanics.  
- Implementing scoring and dynamic rules.  
- Overseeing deployment to **iOS and Android**.  
- Coordinating contributions within the group.  

This role strengthened my skills in **Unity, C# development, mobile deployment, and serious game design**.
