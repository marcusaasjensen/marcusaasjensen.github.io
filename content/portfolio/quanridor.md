✨ **Quanridor** is a multiplayer adaptation of the classic **Quoridor** board game, developed as a school project using only **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
This version introduces a unique **fog of war** mechanic: players can only see tiles within their line of sight, adding depth and strategy to the gameplay.
The game supports both **web and mobile platforms**, with options to play against AI opponents, locally with friends, or online with others.  
Additional systems include chat, emotes, a leaderboard, statistics, and more.
